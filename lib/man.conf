# man.conf
#
# Simplified configuration file, for use with Wu Yongwei's
# and Keith Marshall's MSYS `man' script.
#
# Install as /usr/local/lib/man.conf, /usr/local/share/lib/man.conf
# or /etc/man.conf, according to your preferred file system configuration.
# Modify as required, to suit your configuration.

# Commands for formatting manpages:--
#
PAGER           less -irs
NROFF           groff -Tascii -mandoc -P-c

# Mandatory `groff' preprocessors:--
# (uncomment if you want to force `groff' to use a specific set of filters)
# (this example adds `-pet' to the `groff' command line).
#
# MANROFFSEQ    pet

# Standard manual sections to be searched:--
#
MANSECT         1:1p:8:2:3:3p:4:5:6:7:9:0p:tcl:n:l:p:o

MANPATH         /usr/local/man
MANPATH         /usr/local/share/man
